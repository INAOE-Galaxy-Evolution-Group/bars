Edwin gave a recap of themes discussed in the last meeting.
Edwin demonstrated how the number of times the curve crosses A2 = 0.2 line in A2 vs time can be used a metric for quantifying bar stability
Alan demonstrated how int(A2-0.2) can be used as a metric for bar stability. He also showed that generally no quantities are strongly correlated in the catalog Josue provided.
Josue gave a demonstration on generating visualizations using TNG data.

To do 

1) Download SubhaloBHMass, SubhaloStarMetallicityHalfRad,SubhaloSFRinHalfRad,SubhaloVelDisp for all snapshots.
2) Look for physically motivated correlations.
3) Summarize the exploratory phase.
